1:Normal state save
var normalDino = Runner.prototype.gameOver 

2:  Immortality
Runner.prototype.gameOver = function (){} 

3.1: Speed (replace 1000 with the value you want)
Runner.instance_.setSpeed(1000)

3.2: Jump velocity (replace 30 with the value you want)
Runner.instance_.tRex.setJumpVelocity(30)

4: Immortality cancel
Runner.prototype.gameOver = normalDino


note: #4 won't work without #1, and you should do #1, #2, #3, #4 in order (depends on what you want)
